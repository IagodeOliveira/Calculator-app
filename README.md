## Overview

### The challenge

Users should be able to:

- See the size of the elements adjust based on their device's screen size
- Perform mathmatical operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division
- Adjust the color theme based on their preference
- **Bonus**: Have their initial theme preference checked using `prefers-color-scheme` and have any additional changes saved in the browser

## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- CSS Grid
- Flexbox
- JavaScript

### What I learned

One of the main things that I learned was that JavaScript is really bad at math. I had to put an extra effort trying to get around it. Other thing was that trying to finish a project 100% is harder then doing 80%/90% of it. Making your code cleaner and with less bugs as possible is not an easy task, even if your project is not that complex.

### Continued development

I intend to redo this project and do others projects in the future using classes/objects instead of only using functions. This is a step foward I'll try and achieve that would enven benefit any further MVC structure that I try to implement.

### Useful resources

- [prefers-color-scheme](https://developer.mozilla.org/pt-BR/docs/Web/CSS/@media/prefers-color-scheme) - This article was my first contact with this media feature and helped me to get a good grasp of it.
